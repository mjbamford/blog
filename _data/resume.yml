    title: Full-stack Web Developer | Engineering Head
    description: |
      Full-stack coder, engineering head and educator, I've helped to create unique,
      extraordinary and competitively differentiating products. Software engineers may
      not be fluent in business strategy, and the very fast pace of technology
      means the business may not know the art of the possible. I hope to bridge
      this gap between technology and business through strategy, mentorship,
      innovation, and code. Recent projects include a very large cash-back program
      for one of Australia’s largest municipalities, a talent agency booking system,
      and eCommerce sites heavily dependant upon effective SEO.

      Technology I used: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL with Redis, HTML5 and CSS3
      via Tailwindcss, AWS, Heroku and Render, Shopify and BigCommerce
      eCommerce platforms.
